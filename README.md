## 🏗️ Architecture Principles and Patterns

To ensure code scalability and maintainability, it's crucial that your project has a well-defined and established architecture. I recommend combining clean architecture with vertical slicing/screaming architecture approaches:

1. **Foundational Concepts** 🧱 - Learn essential principles like cohesion, coupling, stability, volatility, SOLID principles, and design patterns: [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/)

2. **Architecture Importance** 💡 - Understanding why good architecture matters for long-term project success: [Martin Fowler on Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/architecture/)

3. **Clean Architecture** ✨ - Principles for creating maintainable, testable, and independent code structures: [Clean Architecture Guide](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

4. **Ports and Adapters** 🔌 - Practical code examples implementing hexagonal architecture: [Port-Adapters Architecture Examples](https://github.com/sebas0811buitrago/port-adapters-architecture)

5. **Vertical Slicing** 📏 - Organizing code by features rather than technical layers: [Vertical Slice Architecture](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/vertical-slice-architecture)

6. **Screaming Architecture** 📢 - Making your architecture intentions clear and obvious: [Screaming Architecture Guide](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/screaming-architecture)

7. **Modular Monoliths** 🏢 - Building maintainable monolithic applications with clear module boundaries: [Modular Monolith Architecture](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/what-is-a-modular-monolith)

## 🚀 Practical Code Agent Workflows

Learn practical workflows and implementation patterns for working effectively with AI code agents, focusing on Claude:

### Claude-Specific Resources

2. **Workflow Tutorial Video** 🎬 - Step-by-step demonstration of effective Claude coding workflows and techniques: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ6sO_0BoTA)

3. **Full-Stack Boilerplate** 🛠️ - Real-world example of a React + FastAPI project structure built with AI assistance: [React-FastAPI Boilerplate](https://github.com/gurusup/react-fastapi-boilerplate/tree/main)

## 💡 Best Practices for AI Code Collaboration

### 📝 Effective Prompting Strategies

- **Be specific and context-rich**: Provide clear requirements, constraints, and examples
- **Break down complex tasks**: Divide large problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Iterate and refine**: Use feedback loops to improve code quality progressively
- **Specify coding standards**: Mention your preferred patterns, frameworks, and conventions

### 🔧 Development Workflow Tips

- **Start with architecture**: Plan your project structure before diving into implementation
- **Use version control**: Make regular commits to track AI-assisted changes
- **Review and test**: Always validate AI-generated code before deployment
- **Document decisions**: Keep track of architectural choices and their reasoning

### ⚡ Productivity Boosters

- **Template creation**: Build reusable project templates with AI assistance
- **Code refactoring**: Leverage AI for systematic code improvements and modernization
- **Learning acceleration**: Use AI to understand new technologies and patterns quickly
- **Problem-solving**: Collaborate with AI to debug complex issues and find optimal solutions
