# BMI Calculator Services Layer Plan

## üîå Local Storage Integration

### Technology Stack

- **Primary Service**: Browser localStorage API
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Transport**: Direct browser API calls

### Service Requirements

- Store BMI calculation records in localStorage
- Retrieve all stored BMI calculations
- Retrieve specific BMI calculation by ID
- Handle data serialization/deserialization
- Manage localStorage capacity and error handling

## üì° Service Implementation Plan

Architecture guidelines: you will find code examples and architecture guidelines here, TAKE A LOOK TO `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc` before implementing anything

<endpoints>
Define localStorage operations for BMI calculations:
- Storage key pattern: "bmi-calculations" for the main collection
- Individual calculation access by filtering the collection
- Handle JSON serialization for complex objects including Date objects
</endpoints>

<interfaces>
Create response and request interfaces for localStorage operations:
- BmiCalculationStorageResponse interface for successful operations
- BmiCalculationStorageError interface for error handling
- BmiCalculationCollection interface for the stored data structure
- Ensure Date objects are properly handled during serialization/deserialization
</interfaces>

<adapters>
Implement adapters for:
- Creating and saving new BMI calculations to localStorage
- Retrieving all BMI calculations from localStorage with proper data transformation
- Retrieving specific BMI calculation by ID
- Error handling for localStorage quota exceeded, unavailable storage, or corrupted data
- Data validation to ensure stored data matches domain entity requirements
- Automatic data migration if storage format changes
</adapters>

<persistence>
localStorage persistence strategy:
- Use a single key "bmi-calculations" to store an array of BMI calculation objects
- Implement versioning for future data format changes
- Handle edge cases like localStorage being disabled or full
- Provide fallback behavior when localStorage is unavailable
- Implement data integrity checks to prevent corruption
</persistence>

## ‚ùì Clarification Questions

- Should there be a maximum number of BMI calculations stored to prevent localStorage overflow?
- How should the system handle localStorage being disabled in the browser?
- Should there be any data backup or export functionality for the stored calculations?
- Are there any specific error recovery strategies needed when localStorage operations fail?
