# BMI Calculator Services Layer Plan

## ðŸ”Œ Local Storage Integration

### Technology Stack

- **Primary Service**: Browser localStorage API
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Transport**: Direct browser API calls

### Service Requirements

- Store BMI calculation records in localStorage
- Retrieve all stored BMI calculations

## ðŸ“¡ Service Implementation Plan

Architecture guidelines: you will find code examples and architecture guidelines here, TAKE A LOOK TO `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc` before implementing anything

<endpoints>
Define localStorage operations for BMI calculations:
- Storage key pattern: "bmi-calculations" for the main collection
- Individual calculation access by filtering the collection
</endpoints>

<interfaces>
Create response and request interfaces for localStorage operations:

- BmiCalculationCollection interface for the stored data structure
- Ensure Date objects are properly handled during serialization/deserialization
  </interfaces>

<adapters>
Implement adapters for:
- Creating and saving new BMI calculations to localStorage
- Retrieving all BMI calculations from localStorage with proper data transformation
- Data validation to ensure stored data matches domain entity requirements
  </adapters>

<persistence>
localStorage persistence strategy:
- Use a single key "bmi-calculations" to store an array of BMI calculation objects
- Implement versioning for future data format changes
</persistence>
